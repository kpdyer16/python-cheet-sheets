# This is the beginning point for the Python cheat sheet(s)
# I decided to separate each topic into different files, so it's easier to manage and study
# All of these files are runnable, valid Python files, and much of the example code 
# just prints out to the console the result of some other code I'm trying to explain

# the '#' symbol is used to comment
print('Hello World') # they can even be placed after normal code

# ^ this prints "Hello World" to the console. 
# to print something out, you enclose it in the parentheses of the print function
# characters within quotation marks (double or single) are called string literals
# we will go further in-depth about functions and literals later on
# for now, just focus on the small stuff, and when you get more curious about details
# Python has documentation online that tells you everything you need to know
# just use the search engine on their site
# https://docs.python.org/3/index.html


print("It's recommended to open this file in a text editor before you try running everything")
